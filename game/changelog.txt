          where a character should be located at any point during their pregnancy.
            - They are stored in a dictionnary, with keys corresponding to each stage of the pregnancy
            - Keys are as follows : "", "_pregnant_bump", "_pregnant_belly", "_labor", "_baby_[girl/boy/twins]"
        - Added a "state_actions" attribute to the pregnancy managers.
            - This attribute allows you to trigger machine actions at various stages of the pregnancy
            - Use the "add_action" method of the PregnancyManager class to set up.
                - takes 3 arguments
                    - key (either "first" or "repeat" depending if you only want to execute the actions the first time or not)
                    - stage (integer that represents the stage of the pregnancy to trigger the action on. Stages increment for every week passed)
                    - actionslist : a list of {i}even{/i} length for the actions. Format is the same as for FSMs
                - Actions are triggered right after the pregnancy manager switched its stage (i.e. at the beginning of the week)
                - Actions are processed for the machine that has the same name as the pregnancy manager, a lookup is done on the store.machines hash table to get that information.
